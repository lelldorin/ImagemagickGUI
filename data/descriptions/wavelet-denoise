mogrify -wavelet-denoise threshold output
mogrify -wavelet-denoise threshold x softness output

removes noise from the image using a wavelet transform. The threshold is the value below which everything is considered noise and ranges from 0.0 (none) to QuantumRange or use percent (e.g. 5%). Softness attenuates the threshold and typically ranges from 0.0 (none) to 1.0. The higher the value the more noise that remains in the image.
