convert -modulate value1, value2, hue input output

The final value, Hue, is actually much more useful. It rotates the colors of the image, in a cyclic manner. To achieve this the Hue value given produces a 'modulus addition', rather than a multiplication.

However be warned that the hue is rotated using a percentage, and not by an angle. This may seem weird but "-modulate" has always been that way.
