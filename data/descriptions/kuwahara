mogrify -kuwahara radius output
mogrify -kuwahara radius x sigma output

edge preserving noise reduction filter.

The radius is more important than the sigma. If sigma is left off, it will be computed automatically from the radius as sigma=radius-0.5. The sigma provides a bit of additional smoothing control.
