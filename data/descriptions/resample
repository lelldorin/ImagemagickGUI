convert -resample Width x Height input output

uses as parameter the desired XxY resolution, not the XxY pixel geometry of the target image. The purpose of this operator is to preserve the rendered size of an image: Assume your image measures 4 inches by 3 inches on a device that renders it at 300 DPI. Then asking for a -resample 72 or -resample 72x72 will resize the image so that it measures (again) 4 inches by 3 inches on a 72 DPI device.
