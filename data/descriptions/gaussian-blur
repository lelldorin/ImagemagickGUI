mogrify -gaussian-blur radius output
mogrify -gaussian-blur radiusxsigma output

Blur the image with a Gaussian operator.

Convolve the image with a Gaussian or normal distribution using the given Sigma value.

The Sigma value is the important argument, and determines the actual amount of blurring that will take place.

The Radius is only used to determine the size of the array which will hold the calculated Gaussian distribution. It should be an integer. If not given, or set to zero, IM will calculate the largest possible radius that will provide meaningful results for the Gaussian distribution.
