convert -distort DePolar Radius_Max Radius_Min Center_X,Center_Y Start_Angle,End_Angle  input output

The 'DePolar' distort is a more low level version of the 'Arc' distortion. It will not automatically do 'bestfit', nor does it try to preserve the aspect ratios of images. This is essentially the inverse of a 'Polar' distortion, and has exactly the same set of optional arguments.
